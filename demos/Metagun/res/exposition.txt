              METAGUN



  ABOUT             

METAGUN WAS MADE BY MARKUS PERSSON IN
AUGUST 2010 FOR LUDUM DARE 18,
A COMPETITION WHERE YOU MAKE A GAME
DURING A SINGLE WEEKEND.


THE THEME OF THE COMPETITION WAS
"ENEMIES AS WEAPONS".



  
  
  THE STORY SO FAR
  
RECENTLY, THE POLITICAL CLIMATE HAS
GROWN WEIRD. SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE
DECLARED THEMSELVES ROADLESS, AND
SOMETHING SOMETHING IN THE MONTH OF MAY.
ANYWAY, YOU FIND THIS TOTALLY AWESOME
GUN THAT SHOOTS SMALLER PEOPLE WITH GUNS
WHO IN TURN SHOOT YOU!


AWESOME!





  CONTROLS
  
USE THE ARROWS KEYS TO MOVE
PRESS Z TO JUMP
PRESS X TO FIRE
PRESS ESCAPE/MENU TO PAUSE THE GAME


ONCE YOU GET THE GUN, YOU CAN AIM UP

AGAIN BY PRESSING EITHER UP OR DOWN.
